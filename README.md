This tool allows you to mod your Watch Dogs game and change a lot of the hidden game files.
# Warning:
This is just a back-up of the original Gibbet Project I do not own any of this content I just made a back-up so if incase the website http://svn.gib.me/builds/disrupt/ goes down modders can still find the tools they need.
