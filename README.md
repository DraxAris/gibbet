Watch Dogs Modding Tool Back-Up
This tool allows you to mod your Watch Dogs game and change a lot of the hidden game files.
# warning:
This is just a back-up of the original Gibbet Project I do not own any of this content I just made a back-up so if incase the website http://svn.gib.me/builds/disrupt/ goes down modders can still find the tools they need.
# Introduction:
1) Download the files
2) Make a folder called "working" and upload the files from this repo in that folder
3) Drag one of the ".dat" or ".fat" files on to the unpack .exe
4) Drag one of the ".dat" or ".fat" files to pack on the pack .exe
